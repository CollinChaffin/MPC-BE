Changes since the last public release (1.6.29):

Version 1.6.30beta01 [April 1, 2017]
  Added missing "$(CPPFLAGS)" to the compile line for c.pic.o in
    makefile.linux and makefile.solaris-x86 (Cosmin).
  Revised documentation of png_get_error_ptr() in the libpng manual.
  Silence clang -Wcomma and const drop warnings (Viktor Szakats).
  Update Sourceforge URLs in documentation (https instead of http).

Version 1.6.30beta02 [April 22, 2017]
  Document need to check for integer overflow when allocating a pixel
    buffer for multiple rows in contrib/gregbook, contrib/pngminus,
    example.c, and in the manual (suggested by Jaeseung Choi). This
    is similar to the bug reported against pngquant in CVE-2016-5735.
  Removed reference to the obsolete PNG_SAFE_LIMITS macro in the documentation.

Version 1.6.30beta03 [May 22, 2017]
  Check for integer overflow in contrib/visupng and contrib/tools/genpng.
  Do not double evaluate CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR in CMakeLists.txt.
  Test CMAKE_HOST_WIN32 instead of WIN32 in CMakeLists.txt.
  Fix some URL in documentation.
