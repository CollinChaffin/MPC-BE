Changes since the last public release (1.6.26):

Version 1.6.27beta01 [November 2, 2016]
  Restrict the new ADLER32-skipping to IDAT chunks.  It broke iCCP chunk
    handling: an erroneous iCCP chunk would throw a png_error and reject the
    entire PNG image instead of rejecting just the iCCP chunk with a warning,
    if built with zlib-1.2.8.1.

Version 1.6.27beta02 [November 8, 2016]
  Revert ADLER32 error handling in pngrutil.c and pngpread.c.
